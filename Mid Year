So far this year, I developed a Python macro that generates an Excel file based on the information from another report. This macro has proven to be very useful, as it significantly speeds up the process and reduces the risk of human error.

I donâ€™t consider this objective fully achieved yet, as I believe I can still implement Python in some of my other tasks.
