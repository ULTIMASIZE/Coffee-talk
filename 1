"Something I’ve been thinking about lately is how to grow within the company. 
I’ve been here for quite a while, and one of the main options seems to be becoming a team leader. 
I’m curious — how and when did you realize that leading people was the right path for you?"

Hi, I’m Nicolás. I’ve been with the company for over 10 years now. 
I started in the Disputes area and worked across several markets during that time. 
I became kind of a go-to person for process knowledge, but eventually I felt there were no more real challenges or growth opportunities there. 
At that point, I saw two paths — either become a team leader or explore something new. 
That’s when I moved into my current role as a GOCM, supporting the Disputes team with my background and experience.

"One of the things I was a bit concerned about when I moved to a new team was how challenging communication might be. 
Not only are we in different countries, but we also have a huge time difference — eight and a half hours. 
I honestly didn’t know how I’d manage if I ran into an issue or needed support. But I was pleasantly surprised. 
I know my manager is always there to help, but I really felt that the transition went smoothly. 
He’s done — and still does — a great job keeping me in the loop with everything that’s going on in the team. 
And whenever I’ve had a question or needed something, he’s either been able to help me right away, or knew exactly who to point me to."
